# MSTU 5013 Final Project: The story of your song (The song of your story)
### By: Danfeng (Ricky) Zhao, Marcus Cheung & Yesika Montoya

#### Design Executive Summary
* Strategy
  * <b>Problem</b>: We currently live in a society that is constantly changing and demanding more from all people. Some of the standards and expectations about performance in all areas of our life seem to be unreachable. We are bombarded by social media sites that constantly present an “invitation” for us to show the best portray of who we are, even when in many cases, it is not accurate picture of our lives. This current life style is leading to disconnection and the sense of lack of genuine relationships among people.  
  * <b>User needs</b>: People are seeking for spaces that are honest and real; at this platform, the users can ask questions, respond to other stories with empathy and fostering a sense of belonging in communities that value being genuine and authentic
  * <b>Goal</b>:With this social platform, we are seeking to create an environment that will foment a genuine emotional experience where people can be vulnerable and share impactful stories of their life and where readers can be vulnerable by using empathy when reading the story, listening the song and connect with the overall experience. We are also hoping that users get to normalize the range of human experiences and emotions. Finally, we hope that the perception regarding vulnerability gets to be described as valuable (instead of the most common myth, which defines it as weakness).
  * <b>Target Audience</b>:We humans have different rituals that are part of the life cycle.  All around the world music and food are part of those rituals. For example, during birthdays, we sing a “happy birthday” song. At weddings, couples have the tendency to dance the first dance and usually the song is one that is meaningful for the couples’ relationship. Therefore, our site is for everyone. Any person who experiences emotions, who will enjoy reading each other’s stories and who would be seeking for emotional connection are the target users.
* Scope
  * In order to provide a friendly space that people could navigate, we created the menu, where the user can browse stories, can create stories and can visit the stories that he user has been sharing.
  * Browse: It presents all the stories that have been submitted so the reader can pick which one to read
  * Create: A new modal window pops in which offers an easy way to share the title of the song, to copy the Youtube link and to write the story that is emotionally attached to the song. Additionally, the user can add the category that in the future could help to classify the results of browsing process.
